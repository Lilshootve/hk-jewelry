        <p>Any information we collect may be used in one of the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Process Transactions or Inquiries:</strong> We use personal information to respond to your inquiries, fulfill product orders, process payments, and deliver products. For example, your address is used for shipping your order.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve Customer Service:</strong> Information you provide helps us effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.</li>
            <li><strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> We may use feedback or data to tailor our service offerings and website content to your interests (for instance, showing you items you may like based on past interest).</li>
            <li><strong>To Send Periodic Emails or Updates:</strong> If you opt-in to our mailing list, the email address you provide may be used to send you updates, newsletters, or information about promotions, new collections, or services.
